          <h3>Accessibility Highlights</h3>
          <div>
            <p>1.1: Mainly sensory and decoration. We were successfully in creating alternative texts for non texts content
            for the pleasure of viewers.<br>
            1.4.4: Our text is resizable and responsive without quality loss.<br>
            2.3: Our content is not designed to cause seizures.<br>
            We made sure to make our website as accessible as possible. Implementing various features to help the users
            <br>with navigation around the website. To make the user experience as conformable as possible.<br>
            This also means that we had to ensure that the amount of flashing light is reduced to the minimum.<br>
            This ensures that the webpage is safe for everyone to view. We also paid attention to our responsive design<br>
            we ensured that we had no quality loss as our text size decreased. We think that these above-mentioned points<br>
            are the most relevant to our webpage.</p>
