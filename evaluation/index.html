          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              In general we consider our webpage to be well accessible to a broad audience. All images have captions and alternative text that is displayed when the image is not available.
              All links are valid, have a title and are clickable. All links are in the same order as they appear on the page.
              This makes navigation easy while at the same time effortless for users that don't have a mouse.
            </p>
            <p>
              After TA feedback and reading the course material for the course we discovered some potential issues with the page. Our tables where not properly responsive,
              so the user would have to scroll horizontally on the page when viewing it with a smaller device or a screen with low resolution. Additionally, we did not properly make use of `print` queries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is our plan to improve those things to improve the Accessability of the website.

          <h3>Accessibility Highlights</h3>
          <div>
            <dl>
              <dt>1.1</dt>
              <dd>Mainly sensory and decoration. We were successfully in creating alternative texts for non texts content
                for the pleasure of viewers.</dd>
              <dt>1.4.4</dt>
              <dd>Our text is resizable and responsive without quality loss.</dd>
              <dt>2.3</dt>
              <dd>Our content is not designed to cause seizures.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
            We made sure to make our website as accessible as possible. Implementing various features to help the users
            <br>with navigation around the website. To make the user experience as conformable as possible.<br>
            This also means that we had to ensure that the amount of flashing light is reduced to the minimum.<br>
            This ensures that the webpage is safe for everyone to view. We also paid attention to our responsive design<br>
            we ensured that we had no quality loss as our text size decreased. We think that these above-mentioned points<br>
            are the most relevant to our webpage.</p>
