          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              In general we consider our webpage to be well accessible to a broad audience. All images have captions and alternative text that is displayed when the image is not available.
              All links are valid, have a title and are clickable. All links are in the same order as they appear on the page.
              This makes navigation easy while at the same time effortless for users that don't have a mouse.
            </p>
            <p>
              After TA feedback and reading the course material for the course we discovered some potential issues with the page. Our tables where not properly responsive,
              so the user would have to scroll horizontally on the page when viewing it with a smaller device or a screen with low resolution. Additionally, we did not properly make use of `print` queries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is our plan to improve those things to improve the Accessability of the website.
